\abstract{
With multiple tech giants offering various cloud based services at competitive prices, lots of companies are shifting their infrastructure to the cloud. This has resulted in huge gains for companies, as they get to focus on their business rather than infrastructure management. In recent times, a new architectural design pattern has emerged, born out of cloud native. This new architecture offers a pay as per use model, allowing companies to spend only as per their requirements. This architecture also allows for infinite scaling, both scale-up and scale-down. Modern workloads on applications vary drastically, and have become increasingly difficult to predict. This leads to the conundrum of resource management, allocating excessive resources in order to prepare for a surge in visitors causes wastage in terms of unused compute resources, whereas allocating a smaller amount of resources can be even more dangerous, leading to loss of potential customers. Serverless architecture allows for a granular level of control over resources, with auto-scaling, thus ensuring that we pay for only what we use, along with scale-up and scale-down depending on workloads. This project aims to compare the various serverless offerings, their pros and cons, and develop a standardised application using the best of services and practices to ensure that the application is fully scalable, and economical such that it serves as a benchmark and proof of concept for all such applications.

For the purpose of this dissertation, we would be building a recipe sharing website, with multiple features like signing up, OAuth login, recipe creation, update, liking, commenting as well as reporting a recipe if it violates our terms. An admin panel allowing for managing complaints, warning users, banning users and archiving recipes would also be supported. A robust search and filtering mechanism would allow any user, even without authentication to browse recipes, and liking or commenting on any would require signing in. Apart from these, our application would automatically be able to estimate the calories of a recipe based on the ingredient list, for which we use a third party API. Overall, this project aims to provide a pleasant user experience for any consumer wishing to browse recipes or share their creations with the world. The future scope of this project would involve a donations page, allowing for users to donate to various charities via the website and help in the maintenance of the application.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to \textbf{Dr. Abdolbaghi Rezazadeh}, my project supervisor, under whose tutelage I have gained a great insight into the project. Our weekly meetings with all the students under professor have been immensely helpful, as it lent to me the motivation and drive to match up with my peers. I also want to thank him for being receptive to any issue I face during the implementation, and for his wholehearted support and advice towards its mitigation.

I would like to thank my sister, \textbf{Diya Gupta}, an avid vegan activist, for introducing me to veganism, and for all the recipes she provided for uploading to the website. It is with her help that I am able to create enough content for this project.

Finally, I would like to thank my father \textbf{Deepak Gupta} and my aunt \textbf{Shashikala Gupta}, who have supported me throughout my life, both morally and financially. It is solely because of them that I got an opportunity to pursue my undergraduate and postgraduate degree.
