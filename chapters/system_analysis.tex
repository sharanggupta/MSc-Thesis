\section{Stakeholders of the system}
The following stakeholders can be identified:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Admin managing reports of users and recipes
  \item Vegan Food Bloggers creating their profile and adding recipes
  \item Logged in registered users allowed to like and comment on recipes
  \item Visitors browsing recipes casually without registering
\end{enumerate}

\section{User requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Register with email id and password
  \item Register and login with OAuth like facebook, instagram, google
  \item Update personal profile to add a bio, description, and social links
  \item Add a new recipe:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
      \item Admin managing reports of users and recipes
      \item Vegan Food Bloggers creating their profile and adding recipes
      \item Logged in registered users allowed to like and comment on recipes
      \item Visitors browsing recipes casually without registering
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Update an existing recipe
  \item Delete an existing recipe
  \item Like recipes with a button
  \item Browse for recipes, search and filter them
\end{enumerate}

\section{System requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cognito or Auth service to manage users. No resources provisioned priorly, Amplify will manage auth by adding or removing users on demand.
  \item Backend scalable database, NoSQL based to allow for dynamic structure like recipes, which can have any number of ingredients and steps. DynamoDB is a good choice. No priorly provisioned hardware/ram/compute, fully scalable.
  \item Lambda functions based on python or javascript(nodejs) to hit the external nutritionix API in order to get calories based on recipe ingredients. Lowest tier lambda function should be suitable for our use case.
  \item S3 storage in order to save static images or videos, for cheap and quick access. No priorly provisioned hardware/ram/compute, fully scalable. S3 infrequently accessed tier would suffice our needs. Can shift to a more performant tier upon scaling up and acquiring enough customers to generate revenue.
\end{enumerate}

\section{User Roles}

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.

\smallskip

With respect to our application, we can identify a number of users and their corresponding end goals:
